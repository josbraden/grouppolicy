      <string id="AddAdminGroupToRUP">Add the Administrators security group to roaming user profiles</string>
      <string id="AddAdminGroupToRUP_Help">This setting adds the Administrator security group to the roaming user profile share.

Once an administrator has configured a users' roaming profile, the profile will be created at the user's next login. The profile is created at the location that is specified by the administrator.

For the Windows 2000 Professional and Windows XP Professional operating systems, the default file permissions for the newly generated profile are full control, or read and write access for the user, and no file access for the administrators group.

By configuring this setting, you can alter this behavior.

If you enable this setting, the administrator group is also given full control to the user's profile folder.

If you disable or do not configure it, only the user is given full control of their user profile, and the administrators group has no file system access to this folder.

Note: If the setting is enabled after the profile is created, the setting has no effect.

Note: The setting must be configured on the client computer, not the server, for it to have any effect, because the client computer sets the file share permissions for the roaming profile at creation time.

Note: In the default case, administrators have no file access to the user's profile, but they may still take ownership of this folder to grant themselves file permissions.

Note: The behavior when this setting is enabled is exactly the same behavior as in Windows NT 4.0.</string>
      <string id="CompatibleRUPSecurity">Do not check for user ownership of Roaming Profile Folders</string>
      <string id="CompatibleRUPSecurity_Help">This setting disables the more secure default setting for the user’s roaming user profile folder.

Once an administrator has configured a users' roaming profile, the profile will be created at the user's next login. The profile is created at the location that is specified by the administrator.

For Windows 2000 Professional pre-SP4 and Windows XP pre-SP1 operating systems, the default file permissions for the newly generated profile are full control access for the user and no file access for the administrators group. No checks are made for the correct permissions if the profile folder already exists. For Windows Server 2003 family, Windows 2000 Professional SP4 and Windows XP SP1, the default behavior is to check the folder for the correct permissions if the profile folder already exists, and not copy files to or from the roaming folder if the permissions are not correct.

By configuring this setting, you can alter this behavior.

If you enable this setting Windows will not check the permissions for the folder in the case where the folder exists.

If you disable or do not configure this setting AND the roaming profile folder exists AND the user or administrators group are not the owner of the folder, Windows will NOT copy files to or from the roaming folder. The user will be shown an error message and an entry will be written to the event log. The user’s cached profile will be used, or a temporary profile issued if no cached profile exists. 

Note: The setting must be configured on the client computer not the server for it to have any effect because the client computer sets the file share permissions for the roaming profile at creation time.

Note: The behavior when this setting is enabled is exactly the same behavior as in Windows 2000 Professional pre-SP4 and Windows XP Professional</string>
      <string id="Connect_HomeDir_ToRoot">Connect home directory to root of the share</string>
      <string id="Connect_HomeDir_ToRoot_Explain">Restores the definitions of the %HOMESHARE% and %HOMEPATH% environment variables to those used in Windows NT 4.0 and earlier.

If you enable this setting, the system uses the Windows NT 4.0 definitions. If you disable this setting or do not configure it, the system uses the new definitions designed for the Windows 2000 operating system.

Along with %HOMEDRIVE%, these variables define the home directory of a user profile. The home directory is a persistent mapping of a drive letter on the local computer to a local or remote directory.

By default, in Windows 2000 Server Family, %HOMESHARE% stores the fully qualified path to the home directory (such as \\server\share\dir1\dir2\homedir). Users can access the home directory and any of its subdirectories from the home drive letter, but they cannot see or access its parent directories. %HOMEPATH% stores a final backslash and is included for compatibility with earlier systems.

On Windows NT 4.0 and earlier, %HOMESHARE% stores only the network share (such as \\server\share). %HOMEPATH% stores the remainder of the fully qualified path to the home directory (such as \dir1\dir2\homedir). As a result, users can access any directory on the home share by using the home directory drive letter.

Tip: To specify a home directory in Windows 2000 Server Family, in Active Directory Users and Computers or Local Users and Groups, right-click the name of a user account, click Properties, click the Profile tab, and in the "Home folder" section, select the "Connect" option and select a drive letter and home directory.

Example: Drive Z is mapped to \\server\share\dir1\dir2\homedir.

If this setting is disabled or not configured (Windows 2000 Server Family behavior):

--  %HOMEDRIVE%  = Z: (mapped to \\server\share\dir1\dir2\homedir)

--  %HOMESHARE% = \\server\share\dir1\dir2\homedir

--  %HOMEPATH% = \

If the setting is enabled (Windows NT 4.0 behavior):

--  %HOMEDRIVE% = Z: (mapped to \\server\share)

--  %HOMESHARE% = \\server\share

--  %HOMEPATH% = \dir1\dir2\homedir</string>
      <string id="DeleteRoamingCachedProfiles">Delete cached copies of roaming profiles</string>
      <string id="DeleteRoamingCachedProfiles_Help">Determines whether the system saves a copy of a user’s roaming profile on the local computer's hard drive when the user logs off.

This setting, and related settings in this folder, together describe a strategy for managing user profiles residing on remote servers. In particular, they tell the system how to respond when a remote profile is slow to load.

Roaming profiles reside on a network server. By default, when users with roaming profiles log off, the system also saves a copy of their roaming profile on the hard drive of the computer they are using in case the server that stores the roaming profile is unavailable when the user logs on again. The local copy is also used when the remote copy of the roaming user profile is slow to load.

If you enable this setting, any local copies of the user’s roaming profile are deleted when the user logs off. The roaming profile still remains on the network server that stores it.

Important: Do not enable this setting if you are using the slow link detection feature of Windows 2000 Professional and Windows XP Professional. To respond to a slow link, the system requires a local copy of the user’s roaming profile.</string>
      <string id="EnableSlowLinkDetect">Do not detect slow network connections</string>
      <string id="EnableSlowLinkDetect_Help">Disables the slow link detection feature.

Slow link detection measures the speed of the connection between a user's computer and the remote server that stores the roaming user profile. When the system detects a slow link, the related settings in this folder tell the system how to respond.

If you enable this setting, the system does not detect slow connections or recognize any connections as being slow. As a result, the system does not respond to slow connections to user profiles, and it ignores the settings that tell the system how to respond to a slow connection.

If you disable this setting or do not configure it, slow link detection is enabled. The system measures the speed of the connection between the user's computer and profile server. If the connection is slow (as defined by the "Slow network connection timeout for user profiles" setting), the system applies the other settings set in this folder to determine how to proceed. By default, when the connection is slow, the system loads the local copy of the user profile.</string>
      <string id="EnableSlowLinkUI">Prompt user when a slow network connection is detected</string>
      <string id="EnableSlowLinkUI_Help">This policy setting provides users with the ability to download their roaming profile, even when a slow network connection with their roaming profile server is detected.

If you enable this policy setting, users will be allowed to define whether they want their roaming profile to be downloaded when a slow link with their roaming profile server is detected.

In operating systems earlier than Microsoft Windows Vista, a dialog box will be shown to the user during logon if a slow network connection is detected. The user then is able to choose to download the remote copy of the user profile. In Microsoft Windows Vista, a check box appears on the logon screen and the user must choose whether to download the remote user profile before Windows detects the network connection speed.  

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the system does not consult the user. Instead, the system uses the local copy of the user profile. If you have enabled the "Wait for remote user profile" policy setting, the system downloads the remote copy of the user profile without consulting the user. In Microsoft Windows Vista, the system will ignore the user choice made on the logon screen.

Note: This policy setting and related policy settings in this folder define the system's response when roaming user profiles are slow to download. To adjust the time within which the user must respond to this notice in operating systems earlier than Microsoft Windows Vista, use the "Timeout for dialog boxes" policy setting.

Important: If the "Do not detect slow network connections" setting is enabled, this policy setting is ignored. Also, if the "Delete cached copies of roaming profiles" policy setting is enabled, there is no local copy of the roaming profile to load when the system detects a slow connection.</string>
      <string id="ExcludeDirectories">Exclude directories in roaming profile</string>
      <string id="ExcludeDirectories_Help">Lets you add to the list of folders excluded from the user's roaming profile.

This setting lets you exclude folders that are normally included in the user's profile. As a result, these folders do not need to be stored by the network server on which the profile resides and do not follow users to other computers.

By default, the Appdata\Local and Appdata\LocalLow folders and all their subfolders like the History, Temp, and Temporary Internet Files folders are excluded from the user's roaming profile.

Note: In operating systems earlier than Microsoft Windows Vista, only the Histroy, Local Settings, Temp, and Temporary Internet Files folders are excluded from the user's roaming profile by default.

If you enable this setting, you can exclude additional folders.

If you disable this setting or do not configure it, only the default folders are excluded.

Note: You cannot use this setting to include the default folders in a roaming user profile.</string>
      <string id="LeaveAppMgmtData">Leave Windows Installer and Group Policy Software Installation Data</string>
      <string id="LeaveAppMgmtData_Help">Determines whether the system retains a roaming user’s Windows Installer and Group Policy based software installation data on their profile deletion.

By default User profile deletes all information related to a roaming user (which includes the user’s settings, data, Windows Installer related data etc.) when their profile is deleted. As a result, the next time a roaming user whose profile was previously deleted on that client logs on, they will need to reinstall all apps published via policy at logon increasing logon time. You can use this policy to change this behavior.

If you enable this setting, Windows will not delete Windows Installer or Group Policy software installation data for roaming users when profiles are deleted from the machine. This will improve the performance of Group Policy based Software Installation during user logon when a user profile is deleted and that user subsequently logs on to the machine.

If you disable or do not configure this policy, Windows will delete the entire profile for roaming users, including the Windows Installer and Group Policy software installation data when those profiles are deleted.

Note: If this policy is enabled for a machine, local administrator action is required to remove the Windows Installer or Group Policy software installation data stored in the registry and file system of roaming users’ profiles on the machine.</string>
      <string id="LimitSize">Limit profile size</string>
      <string id="LimitSize_Help">This policy setting sets the maximum size of each user profile and determines the system's response when a user profile reaches the maximum size. This policy setting affects both local and roaming profiles.

If you disable this policy setting or do not configure it, the system does not limit the size of user profiles.

If you enable this policy setting, you can:

-- Set a maximum permitted user profile size.
-- Determine whether the registry files are included in the calculation of the profile size.
-- Determine whether users are notified when the profile exceeds the permitted maximum size.
-- Specify a customized message notifying users of the oversized profile.
-- Determine how often the customized message is displayed.

Note: In operating systems earlier than Microsoft Windows Vista, Windows will not allow users to log off until the profile size has been reduced to within the allowable limit. In Microsoft Windows Vista, Windows will not block users from logging off. Instead, if the user has a roaming user profile, Windows will not synchronize the user's profile with the roaming profile server if the maximum profile size limit specified here is exceeded.</string>
      <string id="LocalProfile">Only allow local user profiles</string>
      <string id="LocalProfile_Help">This setting determines if roaming user profiles are available on a particular computer. By default, when roaming profile users log on to a computer, their roaming profile is copied down to the local computer. If they have already logged on to this computer in the past, the roaming profile is merged with the local profile. Similarly, when the user logs off this computer, the local copy of their profile, including any changes they have made, is merged with the server copy of their profile.

Using the setting, you can prevent users configured to use roaming profiles from receiving their profile on a specific computer.

If you enable this setting, the following occurs on the affected computer: At first logon, the user receives a new local  profile, rather than the roaming profile. At logoff, changes are saved to the local profile. All subsequent logons use the local profile. 

If you disable this setting or do not configure it, the default behavior occurs, as indicated above.

If you enable both the "Prevent Roaming Profile changes from propagating to the server" setting and the "Only allow local user profiles" setting, roaming profiles are disabled.

Note: This setting only affects roaming profile users.</string>
      <string id="ProfileDlgTimeOut">Timeout for dialog boxes</string>
      <string id="ProfileDlgTimeOut_Help">Determines how long the system waits for a user response before it uses a default value.

The default value is applied when the user does not respond to messages explaining that any of the following events has occurred:

--  The system detects a slow connection between the user's computer and the server that stores users' roaming user profiles.

--  The system cannot access users' server-based profiles when users log on or off.

--  Users' local profiles are newer than their server-based profiles.

You can use this setting to override the system's default value of 30 seconds. To use this setting, type a decimal number between 0 and 600 for the length of the interval.</string>
     <string id="ProfileErrorAction">Do not log users on with temporary profiles</string>
     <string id="ProfileErrorAction_Help">This policy will automatically log off a user when Windows cannot load their profile.
 
If Windows cannot access the user profile folder or the profile contains errors that prevent it from loading, Windows logs on the user with a temporary profile. This policy allows the administrator to disable this behavior, preventing Windows to log on the user with a temporary profile.
 
If you enable this policy setting, Windows will not log on a user with a temporary file. Windows logs the user off if their profile cannot be loaded. 
 
If you disable this policy setting or do not configure it, Windows logs on the user with a temporary profile when Windows cannot load their user profile.
 
Also, see the "Delete cached copies of roaming profiles" setting.</string>
      <string id="ProfileUnloadTimeout">Maximum retries to unload and update user profile</string>
      <string id="ProfileUnloadTimeout_Help">Determines how many times the system tries to unload and update the registry portion of a user profile. When the number of trials specified by this setting is exhausted, the system stops trying. As a result, the user profile might not be current, and local and roaming user profiles might not match.

When a user logs off of the computer, the system unloads the user-specific section of the registry (HKEY_CURRENT_USER) into a file (NTUSER.DAT) and updates it. However, if another program or service is reading or editing the registry, the system cannot unload it. The system tries repeatedly (at a rate of once per second) to unload and update the registry settings. By default, the system repeats its periodic attempts 60 times (over the course of one minute).

If you enable this setting, you can adjust the number of times the system tries to unload and update the user's registry settings. (You cannot adjust the retry rate.)

If you disable this setting or do not configure it, the system repeats its attempt 60 times.

If you set the number of retries to 0, the system tries just once to unload and update the user's registry settings. It does not try again.

Note: This setting is particularly important to servers running Terminal Services. Because Terminal Services edits the users' registry settings when they log off, the system's first few attempts to unload the user settings are more likely to fail.

This setting does not affect the system's attempts to update the files in the user profile.

Tip: Consider increasing the number of retries specified in this setting if there are many user profiles stored in the computer's memory. This indicates that the system has not been able to unload the profile.

Also, check the Application Log in Event Viewer for events generated by Userenv. The system records an event whenever it tries to unload the registry portion of the user profile. The system also records an event when it fails to update the files in a user profile.</string>
      <string id="Readonlyuserprofile">Prevent Roaming Profile changes from propagating to the server</string>
      <string id="Readonlyuserprofile_Help">This setting determines if the changes a user makes to their roaming profile are merged with the server copy of their profile.

By default, when a roaming profile user logs on to a computer, their roaming profile is copied down to the local computer. If they have already logged on to this computer in the past, the roaming profile is merged with the local profile. Similarly, when the user logs off this computer, the local copy of their profile, including any changes they have made, is merged with the server copy of their profile.

Using the setting, you can prevent changes made to a roaming profile on a particular computer from being persisted.

If you enable this setting, the following occurs on the affected computer: At login, the user receives their roaming profile. But, any changes a user makes to their profile will not be merged to their roaming profile when they log off.

If this setting is disabled or not configured, the default behavior occurs, as indicated above.

Note: This setting only affects roaming profile users.</string>
      <string id="SlowLinkDefault">Wait for remote user profile</string>
      <string id="SlowLinkDefault_Help">Directs the system to wait for the remote copy of the roaming user profile to load, even when loading is slow. Also, the system waits for the remote copy when the user is notified about a slow connection, but does not respond in the time allowed.

This setting and related settings in this folder together define the system's response when roaming user profiles are slow to load.

If you disable this setting or do not configure it, then when a remote profile is slow to load, the system loads the local copy of the roaming user profile. The local copy is also used when the user is consulted (as set in the "Prompt user when slow link is detected" setting), but does not respond in the time allowed (as set in the "Timeout for dialog boxes" setting).

Waiting for the remote profile is appropriate when users move between computers frequently and the local copy of their profile is not always current. Using the local copy is desirable when quick logging on is a priority.

Important: If the "Do not detect slow network connections" setting is enabled, this setting is ignored. Also, if the "Delete cached copies of roaming profiles" setting is enabled, there is no local copy of the roaming profile to load when the system detects a slow connection.</string>
      <string id="SlowLinkTimeOut">Slow network connection timeout for user profiles</string>
      <string id="SlowLinkTimeOut_Help">Defines a slow connection for roaming user profiles.

If the server on which the user's roaming user profile resides takes longer to respond than the thresholds set by this setting allow, then the system considers the connection to the profile to be slow.

This setting and related settings in this folder together define the system's response when roaming user profiles are slow to load.

This setting establishes thresholds for two tests. For computers connected to IP networks, the system measures the rate at which the remote server returns data in response to an IP ping message. To set a threshold for this test, in the Connection speed box, type a decimal number between 0 and 4,294,967,200, representing the minimum acceptable transfer rate in kilobits per second. By default, if the server returns fewer than 500 kilobits of data per second, it is considered to be slow.

For non-IP computers, the system measures the responsiveness of the remote server's file system. To set a threshold for this test, in the Time box, type a decimal number between 0 and 20,000, representing the maximum acceptable delay, in milliseconds. By default, if the server's file system does not respond within 120 milliseconds, it is considered to be slow.

Consider increasing this value for clients using DHCP Service-assigned addresses or for computers accessing profiles across dial-up connections.

Important: If the "Do not detect slow network connections" setting is enabled, this setting is ignored. Also, if the "Delete cached copies of roaming profiles" setting is enabled, there is no local copy of the roaming profile to load when the system detects a slow connection.</string>

This policy setting is meant to be used in conjunction with Folder Redirection, to help resolve issues with applications that do not work well with Offline Files while the user is online.

If you enable this policy setting, the network paths specified in this policy setting will be synchronized only by Offline Files during user logon and logoff, and will be taken offline while the user is logged on.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the paths specified in this policy setting will behave like any other cached data via Offline Files and continue to remain online while the user is logged on, if the network paths are accessible.   

Note: You should not use this policy setting to suspend any of the root redirected folders such as Appdata\Roaming, Start Menu, and Documents. You should suspend only the subfolders of these parent folders.</string>

      <string id="DontForceUnloadHive_Help">Microsoft Windows will always unload the users registry, even if there are any open handles to the per-user registry keys at user logoff. Using this policy setting, an administrator can negate this behavior, preventing Windows from forcefully unloading the users registry at user logoff.

Note: This policy should only be used for cases where you may be running into application compatibility issues due to this specific Windows behavior.  It is not recommended to enable this policy by default as it may prevent users from getting an updated version of their roaming user profile.

If you enable this policy setting, Windows will not forcefully unload the users registry at logoff, but will unload the registry when all open handles to the per-user registry keys are closed.

      <string id="WaitForNetwork_Help">If the user has a roaming user profile or remote home directory and the network is currently unavailable, Microsoft Windows waits 30 seconds for the network when the user logs on to the computer. Using this policy setting, an administrator can specify how long Windows should wait for the network to become available. If the network is unavailable after the maximum wait time, Windows will continue the log on the user without a network connection. The user's roaming profile is not synchronized with the server, and the remote home directory is not used for the logon session. 

This policy is useful for the cases in which a network may take typically longer to initialize, such as with a wireless network.

Note: If the network becomes available before the maximum wait time, Windows will proceed immediately with the user logon. Windows will not wait on the network if the physical network connection is not available on the computer (if the media is disconnected or the network adapter is not available).
 
If you enable this policy setting, Windows will wait for the network to become available up to the maximum wait time specified in this policy setting. Setting the value to zero will cause Windows to proceed without waiting for the network.

To use this setting, type the path to the network share in the form \\Computername\Sharename\. It is recommended to add %USERNAME% to the path to give each user an individual profile folder. If not specified, all users logging onto this computer will use the same roaming profile folder as specified by this policy. You need to ensure that you have set the appropriate security on the folder to allow all users to access the profile.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, then users logging on this computer will use their local profile or standard roaming user profile.   

Note: There are 4 ways to configure a roaming profile for a user. Windows reads profile configuration in the following order and uses the first configured setting it reads.
 
1. Terminal Services roaming profile path specified by Terminal Services policy
2. Terminal Services roaming profile path specified by the user object
3. A per-computer roaming profile path specified in this policy
4. A per-user roaming profile path specified in the user object

      <string id="UploadHive">Background upload of a roaming user profile's registry file while user is logged on</string>
      <string id="UploadHive_Help">Sets the schedule for background uploading of a roaming user profile's registry file (ntuser.dat).  This setting will only upload the user profile's registry file (other user data will not be uploaded) and will only upload it if the user is logged on.  Only the registry file of a roaming user profile will be uploaded--regular profiles will not be affected.  This policy does not stop the roaming user profile's registry file from being uploaded at user logoff.

If this setting is disabled or not configured, the registry file for a roaming user profile will not be uploaded in the background while the user is logged on.

To use this setting, first choose which scheduling method to use.

If "Run at set interval" is chosen, then an interval must be set, with a value of 1-720 hours.  Once set, the profile's registry file will be uploaded at the specified interval after the user logs on.  For example, with a value of 6 hours, if a user logs on at 6:00am and is still logged in at 12:00pm, their registry file will be uploaded at that time.  Further, if they are still logged in at 6pm, it will upload then, as well, and again every 6 hours until logoff.  The next time the user logs on, the timer will start again, so the registry file will upload 6 hours later (in our example.)

If "Run at specified time of day" is chosen, then a time of day must be specified.  Once set, the registry hive will be uploaded at that same time every day, assuming the user is logged on at that time.

For both scheduling options, there is a random one hour delay attached per-trigger to avoid overloading the server with simultaneous uploads.  For example, if the settings dictate that the user's registry file is to be uploaded at 6pm, it will actually upload at a random time between 6pm and 7pm.

Note:  If "Run at set interval" is selected, the "Time of day" option is disregarded.  Likewise, if "Run at set time of day" is chosen, the "Interval (hours)" option is disregarded.</string>
