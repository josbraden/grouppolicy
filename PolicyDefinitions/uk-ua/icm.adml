    <stringTable>
      <string id="CertMgr_DisableAutoRootUpdates">Turn off Automatic Root Certificates Update</string>
      <string id="CertMgr_DisableAutoRootUpdates_Help">Specifies whether to automatically update root certificates using the Windows Update Web site. 

Typically, a certificate is used when you use a secure Web site or when you send and receive secure e-mail. Anyone can issue certificates, but to have transactions that are as secure as possible, certificates must be issued by a trusted certificate authority (CA). Microsoft has included a list in Windows XP and other products of companies and organizations that it considers trusted authorities.

If you enable this setting, when you are presented with a certificate issued by an untrusted root authority your computer will not contact the Windows Update web site to see if Microsoft has added the CA to its list of trusted authorities.

If you disable or do not configure this setting, your computer will contact the Windows Update Web site.</string>
      <string id="DisableHTTPPrinting">Turn off printing over HTTP</string>
      <string id="DisableHTTPPrinting_Help">Specifies whether to allow printing over HTTP from this client.

Printing over HTTP allows a client to print to printers on the intranet as well as the Internet.

Note: This setting affects the client side of Internet printing only. It does not prevent this machine from acting as an Internet Printing server and making its shared printers available via HTTP.

If you enable this setting, it prevents this client from printing to Internet printers over HTTP.

If you disable or do not configure this setting, users will be able to choose to print to Internet printers over HTTP.

Also see the "Web-based Printing" setting in Computer Configuration/Administrative Templates/Printers.</string>
      <string id="DisableWebPnPDownload">Turn off downloading of print drivers over HTTP</string>
      <string id="DisableWebPnPDownload_Help">Specifies whether to allow this client to download print driver packages over HTTP.

To set up HTTP printing, non-inbox drivers need to be downloaded over HTTP.

Note: This setting does not prevent the client from printing to printers on the Intranet or the Internet over HTTP.  It only prohibits downloading drivers that are not already installed locally.

If you enable this setting, print drivers will not be downloaded over HTTP.

If you disable this setting or do not configure it, users will be able to download print drivers over HTTP.</string>
      <string id="DriverSearchPlaces_DontSearchWindowsUpdate">Turn off Windows Update device driver searching</string>
      <string id="DriverSearchPlaces_DontSearchWindowsUpdate_Help">This policy specifies whether Windows searches Windows Update for device drivers when no local drivers for a device are present.

If you enable this setting, Windows Update will not be searched when a new device is installed.

If you disable this setting, Windows Update will always be searched for drivers when no local drivers are present.

If you do not configure this setting, searching Windows Update will be optional when installing a device.

Also see "Turn off Windows Update device driver search prompt" in "Administrative Templates/System" which governs whether an administrator is prompted before searching Windows Update for device drivers if a driver is not found locally.

NOTE: This setting is replaced by "Specify Driver Source Search Order" in "Administrative Templates/System/Device Installation" on newer versions of Windows.</string>
      <string id="EventViewer_DisableLinks">Turn off Event Viewer "Events.asp" links</string>
      <string id="EventViewer_DisableLinks_Help">Specifies whether "Events.asp" hyperlinks are available for events within the Event Viewer application.

The Event Viewer normally makes all HTTP(S) URLs into hot links that activate the Internet browser when clicked. In addition, "More Information" is placed at the end of the description text if the event is created by a Microsoft component. This text contains a link (URL) that, if clicked, sends information about the event to Microsoft, and allows users to learn more about why that event occurred.

If you enable this setting, event description URL links are not activated and the text "More Information" is not displayed at the end of the description.

If you disable or do not configure this setting, the user can click the hyperlink which prompts the user and then sends information about the event over the internet to Microsoft.  Also, see "Events.asp URL", "Events.asp program", and "Events.asp Program Command Line Parameters" settings in "Administrative Templates/Windows Components/Event Viewer".</string>
      <string id="HSS_HeadlinesPolicy">Turn off Help and Support Center "Did you know?" content</string>

If you enable this setting, the Help and Support Center will no longer retrieve nor display "Did you know?" content.

If you disable or do not configure this setting, the Help and Support Center will retrieve and display "Did you know?" content.

You might want to enable this setting for users who do not have Internet access, because the content in the "Did you know?" section will remain static indefinitely without an Internet connection.</string>
      <string id="HSS_KBSearchPolicy">Turn off Help and Support Center Microsoft Knowledge Base search</string>
      <string id="HSS_KBSearchPolicy_Help">Specifies whether users can perform a Microsoft Knowledge Base search from the Help and Support Center.

The Knowledge Base is an online source of technical support information and self-help tools for Microsoft products and is searched as part of all Help and Support Center searches with the default search options.

If you enable this setting, it will remove the Knowledge Base section from the Help and Support Center "Set search options" page and only help content on the local computer will be searched. 

If you disable this setting or do not configure it, the Knowledge Base will be searched if the user has a connection to the Internet and has not disabled the Knowledge Base search from the Search Options page.</string>
      <string id="InternetManagement_RestrictCommunication">Restrict Internet communication</string>
      <string id="InternetManagement_RestrictCommunication_Help">Specifies whether Windows can access the Internet to accomplish tasks that require Internet resources.

If this setting is enabled, all of the the policy settings listed in the "Internet Communication settings" section will be set such that their respective features can not access the Internet.

      <string id="NC_ExitOnISP_Help">Specifies whether the Internet Connection Wizard can connect to Microsoft to download a list of Internet Service Providers (ISPs).

If you enable this setting, the "Choose a list of Internet Service Providers" path in the Internet Connection Wizard will cause the wizard to exit.  This prevents users from retrieving the list of ISPs, which resides on Microsoft servers.

If you disable or do not configure this setting, users will be able to connect to Microsoft to download a list of ISPs for their area.</string>
      <string id="NC_NoRegistration">Turn off Registration if URL connection is referring to Microsoft.com</string>
      <string id="NC_NoRegistration_Help">Specifies whether the Windows Registration Wizard connects to Microsoft.com for online registration.

If you enable this setting, all Windows Update features are removed. This includes blocking access to the Windows Update Web site at http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com, from the Windows Update hyperlink on the Start menu, and also on the Tools menu in Internet Explorer. Windows automatic updating is also disabled; you will neither be notified about nor will you receive critical updates from Windows Update. This setting also prevents Device Manager from automatically installing driver updates from the Windows Update Web site.

If you disable or do not configure this setting, users will be able to access the Windows Update Web site and enable automatic updating to receive notifications and critical updates from Windows Update.</string>
      <string id="SearchCompanion_DisableFileUpdates">Turn off Search Companion content file updates</string>
      <string id="SearchCompanion_DisableFileUpdates_Help">Specifies whether Search Companion should automatically download content updates during local and Internet searches.

When the user searches the local machine or the Internet, Search Companion occasionally connects to Microsoft to download an updated privacy policy and additional content files used to format and display results.

      <string id="ShellNoUseInternetOpenWith_Help">Specifies whether to use the Microsoft Web service for finding an application to open a file with an unhandled file association.

When a user opens a file that has an extension that is not associated with any applications on the machine, the user is given the choice to choose a local application or use the Web service to find an application.

If you enable this setting, the link and the dialog for using the Web service to open an unhandled file association are removed.

      <string id="ShellPreventWPWDownload_Help">Specifies whether Windows should download a list of providers for the Web publishing and online ordering wizards.

These wizards allow users to select from a list of companies that provide services such as online storage and photographic printing.  By default, Windows displays providers downloaded from a Windows Web site in addition to providers specified in the registry.

If you enable this setting, Windows will not download providers and only the service providers that are cached in the local registry will be displayed.

If you disable or do not configure this setting, a list of providers will be downloaded when the user uses the Web publishing or online ordering wizards.

As part of determining the connectivity level, NCSI performs one of two active tests: downloading a page from a dedicated Web server or making a DNS request for a dedicated address.

If you enable this policy setting, NCSI does not run either of the two active tests. This may reduce the ability of NCSI, and of other components that use NCSI, to determine Internet access. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, NCSI runs one of the two active tests.
