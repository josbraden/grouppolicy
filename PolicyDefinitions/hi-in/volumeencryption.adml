      <string id="ActiveDirectoryBackup_Help">This policy setting allows you to manage the Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) backup of BitLocker Drive Encryption recovery information. This provides an administrative method of recovering data encrypted by BitLocker to prevent data loss due to lack of key information. This policy is only applicable to computers running Windows Server 2008 or Windows Vista.

If you enable this policy setting, BitLocker recovery information will be automatically and silently backed up to AD DS when BitLocker is turned on for a computer. This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.

Note: You must first set up appropriate schema extensions and access control settings on the domain before AD DS backup can succeed. Consult the BitLocker Drive Encryption Deployment Guide on Microsoft TechNet for more information about setting up AD DS backup for BitLocker.

BitLocker recovery information includes the recovery password and some unique identifier data. You can also include a package that contains a BitLocker-protected drive's encryption key. This key package is secured by one or more recovery passwords and may help perform specialized recovery when the disk is damaged or corrupted.

If you select the option to "Require BitLocker backup to AD DS" BitLocker cannot be turned on unless the computer is connected to the domain and the backup of BitLocker recovery information to AD DS succeeds. This option is selected by default to help ensure that BitLocker recovery is possible. If this option is not selected, AD DS backup is attempted but network or other backup failures do not prevent BitLocker setup. Backup is not automatically retried and the recovery password may not have been stored in AD DS during BitLocker setup.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, BitLocker recovery information will not be backed up to AD DS.

Note: Trusted Platform Module (TPM) initialization may be needed during BitLocker setup. Enable the "Turn on TPM backup to Active Directory Domain Services" policy setting in System\Trusted Platform Module Services to ensure that TPM information is also backed up.

      <string id="ConfigureStartupUsage_Help">This policy setting allows you to control whether the BitLocker Drive Encryption setup wizard will be able to set up an additional authentication method that is required each time the computer starts. This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.
        
Note:  This policy is only applicable to computers running Windows Server 2008 or Windows Vista.

On a computer with a compatible Trusted Platform Module (TPM), two authentication methods can be used at startup to provide added protection for encrypted data. When the computer starts, it can require users to insert a USB flash drive containing a startup key. It can also require users to enter a 4-digit to 20-digit startup personal identification number (PIN).

A USB flash drive containing a startup key is needed on computers without a compatible TPM. Without a TPM, BitLocker-encrypted data is protected solely by the key material on this USB flash drive.

If you enable this policy setting, the wizard will display the page to allow the user to configure advanced startup options for BitLocker. You can further configure setting options for computers with and without a TPM.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the BitLocker setup wizard will display basic steps that allow users to enable BitLocker on computers with a TPM. In this basic wizard, no additional startup key or startup PIN can be configured.
</string>
      
      <string id="ConfigureStartupUsage_Name">Require additional authentication at startup (Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista)</string>
      <string id="ConfigureAdvancedStartup_Name">Require additional authentication at startup</string>
      
      <string id="ConfigureAdvancedStartup_Help">This policy setting allows you to configure whether BitLocker requires additional authentication each time the computer starts and whether you are using BitLocker with or without a Trusted Platform Module (TPM). This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.

Note: Only one of the additional authentication options can be required at startup, otherwise a policy error occurs.

If you want to use BitLocker on a computer without a TPM, select the "Allow BitLocker without a compatible TPM" check box. In this mode a USB drive is required for start-up and the key information used to encrypt the drive is stored on the USB drive, creating a USB key. When the USB key is inserted the access to the drive is authenticated and the drive is accessible. If the USB key is lost or unavailable you will need to use one of the BitLocker recovery options to access the drive.

On a computer with a compatible TPM, four types of authentication methods can be used at startup to provide added protection for encrypted data. When the computer starts, it can use only the TPM for authentication, or it can also require insertion of a USB flash drive containing a startup key, the entry of a 4-digit to 20-digit personal identification number (PIN), or both.

If you enable this policy setting, users can configure advanced startup options in the BitLocker setup wizard.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, users can configure only basic options on computers with a TPM.

Note: If you want to require the use of a startup PIN and a USB flash drive, you must configure BitLocker settings using the command-line tool manage-bde instead of the BitLocker Drive Encryption setup wizard.

      <string id="ConfigureRecoveryUsage_Help">This policy setting allows you to control whether the BitLocker Drive Encryption setup wizard can display and specify BitLocker recovery options. This policy is only applicable to computers running Windows Server 2008 or Windows Vista. This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.

Two recovery options can be used to unlock BitLocker-encrypted data in the absence of the required startup key information. The user either can type a 48-digit numerical recovery password or insert a USB flash drive containing a 256-bit recovery key.

If you enable this policy setting, you can configure the options that the setup wizard displays to users for recovering BitLocker encrypted data. Saving to a USB flash drive will store the 48-digit recovery password as a text file and the 256-bit recovery key as a hidden file. Saving to a folder will store the 48-digit recovery password as a text file. Printing will send the 48-digit recovery password to the default printer. For example, not allowing the 48-digit recovery password will prevent users from being able to print or save recovery information to a folder.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the BitLocker setup wizard will present users with ways to store recovery options.

Note: If Trusted Platform Module (TPM) initialization is needed during the BitLocker setup, TPM owner information will be saved or printed with the BitLocker recovery information.

Note: The 48-digit recovery password will not be available in FIPS-compliance mode.

Important: This policy setting provides an administrative method of recovering data encrypted by BitLocker to prevent data loss due to lack of key information. If you do not allow both user recovery options you must enable the "Store BitLocker recovery information in Active Directory Domain Services (Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista)" policy setting to prevent a policy error.

This policy setting does not apply if the computer does not have a compatible TPM or if BitLocker has already been turned on with TPM protection.

If you enable this policy setting before turning on BitLocker, you can configure the boot components that the TPM will validate before unlocking access to the BitLocker-encrypted operating system drive. If any of these components change while BitLocker protection is in effect, the TPM will not release the encryption key to unlock the drive and the computer will instead display the BitLocker Recovery console and require that either the recovery password or recovery key be provided to unlock the drive.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the TPM uses the default platform validation profile or the platform validation profile specified by the setup script. A platform validation profile consists of a set of Platform Configuration Register (PCR) indices ranging from 0 to 23, The default platform validation profile secures the encryption key against changes to the Core Root of Trust of Measurement (CRTM), BIOS, and Platform Extensions (PCR 0), the Option ROM Code (PCR 2), the Master Boot Record (MBR) Code (PCR 4), the NTFS Boot Sector (PCR 8), the NTFS Boot Block (PCR 9), the Boot Manager (PCR 10), and the BitLocker Access Control (PCR 11). The descriptions of PCR settings for computers that use an Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) are different than the PCR settings described for computers that use a standard BIOS. The BitLocker Drive Encryption Deployment Guide on Microsoft TechNet contains a complete list of PCR settings for both EFI and standard BIOS.

Warning: Changing from the default platform validation profile affects the security and manageability of your computer. BitLocker's sensitivity to platform modifications (malicious or authorized) is increased or decreased depending upon inclusion or exclusion (respectively) of the PCRs.

These identifiers are stored as the identification field and allowed identification field. The identification field allows you to associate a unique organizational identifier to BitLocker-protected drives. This identifier is automatically added to new BitLocker-protected drives and can be updated on existing BitLocker-protected drives using the Manage-BDE command-line tool. An identification field is required for management of certificate-based data recovery agents on BitLocker-protected drives and for potential updates to the BitLocker To Go Reader. BitLocker will only manage and update data recovery agents when the identification field on the drive matches the value configured in the identification field. In a similar manner, BitLocker will only update the BitLocker To Go Reader when the identification field on the drive matches the value configured for the identification field.

The allowed identification field is used in combination with the "Deny write access to removable drives not protected by BitLocker" policy setting to help control the use of removable drives in your organization. It is a comma separated list of identification fields from your organization or other external organizations.

You can configure the identification fields on existing drives by using manage-BDE.exe.

If you enable this policy setting, you can configure the identification field on the BitLocker-protected drive and any allowed identification field used by your organization.

When a BitLocker-protected drive is mounted on another BitLocker-enabled computer the identification field and allowed identification field will be used to determine whether the drive is from an outside organization.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the identification field is not required.

Note: Identification fields are required for management of certificate-based data recovery agents on BitLocker-protected drives. BitLocker will only manage and update certificate-based data recovery agents when the identification field is present on a drive and is identical to the value configured on the computer. The identification field can be any value of 260 characters or fewer.

If you choose to permit the use of a password, you can require that a password be used, enforce complexity requirements on the password, and configure a minimum length for the password. For the complexity requirement setting to be effective the Group Policy setting "Password must meet complexity requirements" located in Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account Policies\Password Policy\ must be also enabled.
        
Note: These settings are enforced when turning on BitLocker, not when unlocking a volume. BitLocker will allow unlocking a drive with any of the protectors available on the drive.

If you enable this policy setting, users can configure a password that meets the requirements you define. To require the use of a password, select "Require password for fixed data drive". To enforce complexity requirements on the password, select "Require complexity".

When set to "Require complexity" a connection to a domain controller is necessary when BitLocker is enabled to validate the complexity the password. When set to "Allow complexity" a connection to a domain controller will be attempted to validate the complexity adheres to the rules set by the policy, but if no domain controllers are found the password will still be accepted regardless of actual password complexity and the drive will be encrypted using that password as a protector. When set to "Do not allow complexity", no password complexity validation will be done.

Passwords must be at least 8 characters. To configure a greater minimum length for the password, enter the desired number of characters in the "Minimum password length" box.

If you disable this policy setting, the user is not allowed to use a password.

If you do not configure this policy setting, passwords will be supported with the default settings, which do not include password complexity requirements and require only 8 characters.

Note: Passwords cannot be used if FIPS-compliance is enabled. The "System cryptography: Use FIPS-compliant algorithms for encryption, hashing, and signing" policy setting in Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\Security Options specifies whether FIPS-compliance is enabled.

      <string id="RDVPassphrase_Name">Configure use of passwords for removable data drives</string>
      <string id="RDVPassphrase_Help">This policy setting specifies whether a password is required to unlock BitLocker-protected removable data drives. If you choose to allow use of a password, you can require a password to be used, enforce complexity requirements, and configure a minimum length. For the complexity requirement setting to be effective the Group Policy setting "Password must meet complexity requirements" located in Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account Policies\Password Policy\ must be also enabled.

Note: These settings are enforced when turning on BitLocker, not when unlocking a volume. BitLocker will allow unlocking a drive with any of the protectors available on the drive.

If you enable this policy setting, users can configure a password that meets the requirements that you define. To require the use of a password, select "Require password for removable data drive". To enforce complexity requirements on the password, select "Require complexity".

When set to "Require complexity" a connection to a domain controller is necessary when BitLocker is enabled to validate the complexity the password. When set to "Allow complexity" a connection to a domain controller will be attempted to validate the complexity adheres to the rules set by the policy, but if no domain controllers are found the password will still be accepted regardless of actual password complexity and the drive will be encrypted using that password as a protector. When set to "Do not allow complexity", no password complexity validation will be done.

Passwords must be at least 8 characters. To configure a greater minimum length for the password, enter the desired number of characters in the "Minimum password length" box.

If you disable this policy setting, the user is not allowed to use a password.

If you do not configure this policy setting, passwords will be supported with the default settings, which do not include password complexity requirements and require only 8 characters.

Note: Passwords cannot be used if FIPS-compliance is enabled. The "System cryptography: Use FIPS-compliant algorithms for encryption, hashing, and signing" policy setting in Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\Security Options specifies whether FIPS-compliance is enabled.
