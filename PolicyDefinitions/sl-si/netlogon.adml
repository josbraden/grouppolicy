      <string id="Netlogon_AllowSingleLabelDnsDomain_Help">Specifies whether the computers to which this setting is applied attempt DNS name resolution of a single-label domain names.

By default, when a computer (or the DC Locator running on a computer, to be more specific) needs to locate a domain controller hosting an Active Directory domain specified with a single-label name, the computer exclusively uses NetBIOS name resolution, but not the DNS name resolution, unless the computer is joined to an Active Directory forest in which at least one domain has a single-label DNS name. 

If this setting is enabled, computers to which this policy is applied will attempt to locate a domain controller hosting an Active Directory domain specified with a single-label name using DNS name resolution.

If this setting is disabled, computers to which this setting is applied will attempt to locate a domain controller hosting an Active Directory domain specified with a single-label name only using NetBIOS name resolution, but not the DNS name resolution, unless the computer is searching for a domain with a single label DNS name that exists in the Active Directory forest to which this computer is joined.

      <string id="Netlogon_DnsRefreshInterval_Help">Specifies the Refresh Interval of the domain controller (DC) Locator DNS resource records for DCs to which this setting is applied. These DNS records are dynamically registered by the Net Logon service and are used by the Locator algorithm to locate the DC. This setting may be applied only to DCs using dynamic update.

DCs configured to perform dynamic registration of the DC Locator DNS resource records periodically reregister their records with DNS servers, even if their records’ data has not changed. If authoritative DNS servers are configured to perform scavenging of the stale records, this reregistration is required to instruct the DNS servers configured to automatically remove (scavenge) stale records that these records are current and should be preserved in the database.

Warning: If the DNS resource records are registered in zones with scavenging enabled, the value of this setting should never be longer than the Refresh Interval configured for these zones. Setting the Refresh Interval of the DC Locator DNS records to longer than the Refresh Interval of the DNS zones may result in the undesired deletion of DNS resource records.

To specify the Refresh Interval of the DC records, click Enabled, and then enter a value larger than 1800. This value specifies the Refresh Interval of the DC records in seconds (for example, the value 3600 is 60 minutes).

The Weight field in the SRV record can be used in addition to the Priority value to provide a load-balancing mechanism where multiple servers are specified in the SRV records Target field and are all set to the same priority. The probability with which the DNS client randomly selects the target host to be contacted is proportional to the Weight field value in the SRV record.

When this setting is disabled or not configured, the Netlogon share will grant shared read access to files on the share when exclusive access is requested and the caller has only read permission.

By default, the Netlogon share will grant shared read access to files on the share when exclusive access is requested.

Note: The Netlogon share is a share created by the Net Logon service for use by client machines in the domain. The default behavior of the Netlogon share ensures that no application with only read permission to files on the Netlogon share can lock the files by requesting exclusive read access, which might prevent Group Policy settings from being updated on clients in the domain. When this setting is enabled, an application that relies on the ability to lock files on the Netlogon share with only read permission will be able to deny Group Policy clients from reading the files, and in general the availability of the Netlogon share on the domain will be decreased.

If this setting is enabled, domain administrators should ensure that the only applications using the exclusive read capability in the domain are those approved by the administrator.</string>

      <string id="Netlogon_TryNextClosestSite_Help">The Domain Controller Locator (DC Locator) service is used by clients to find domain controllers for their Active Directory domain. The default behavior for DC Locator is to find a DC in the same site. If none are found in the same site, a DC in another site, which might be several site-hops away, could be returned by DC Locator. Site proximity between two sites is determined by the total site-link cost between them. A site is closer if it has a lower site link cost than another site with a higher site link cost. The Try Next Closest Site feature enables DC Locator to attempt to locate a DC in the nearest site based on the site link cost if a DC in same the site is not found. In scenarios with multiple sites, failing over to the try next closest site during DC Location streamlines network traffic more effectively.

If you enable this policy setting, Try Next Closest Site DC Location will be turned on for the machine across all available but un-configured network adapters.

If you disable this policy setting, Try Next Closest Site DC Location will not be used by default for the machine across all available but un-configured network adapters. However, if a DC Locator call is made using the DS_TRY_NEXTCLOSEST_SITE flag explicitly, the Try Next Closest Site behavior is honored.

      <string id="Netlogon_ForceRediscoveryInterval">Force Rediscovery Interval</string>
      <string id="Netlogon_ForceRediscoveryInterval_Help">The Domain Controller Locator (DC Locator) service is used by clients to find domain controllers for their Active Directory domain. When DC Locator finds a domain controller, it caches domain controllers to improve the efficiency of the location algorithm. As long as the cached domain controller meets the requirements and is running, DC Locator will continue to return it. If a new domain controller is introduced, existing clients will only discover it when a Force Rediscovery is carried out by DC Locator. To adapt to changes in network conditions DC Locator will by default carry out a Force Rediscovery according to a specific time interval and maintain efficient load-balancing of clients across all available domain controllers in all domains or forests. The default time interval for Force Rediscovery by DC Locator is 12 hours. Force Rediscovery can also be triggered if a call to DC Locator uses the DS_FORCE_REDISCOVERY flag. Rediscovery resets the timer on the cached domain controller entries.

If you enable this policy setting, DC Locator on the machine will carry out Force Rediscovery periodically according to the configured time interval. The minimum time interval is 3600 seconds (1 hour) to avoid excessive network traffic from rediscovery. The maximum allowed time interval is 4294967200 seconds, while any value greater than 4294967 seconds (~49 days) will be treated as infinity.

If you disable this policy setting, Force Rediscovery will be used by default for the machine at every 12 hour interval.

Before the support of IPv6, the returned DC IP address was IPv4. But with the support of IPv6, the DC Locator APIs can return IPv6 DC address. The returned IPv6 DC address may not be correctly handled by some of the existing applications. So this policy is provided to support such scenarios.

By default, DC Locator APIs can return IPv4/IPv6 DC address. But if some applications are broken due to the returned IPv6 DC address, this policy can be used to disable the default behavior and enforce to return ONLY IPv4 DC address. Once applications are fixed, this policy can be used to enable the default behavior.

If you enable this policy setting, DC Locator APIs can return IPv4/IPv6 DC address. This is the default behavior of the DC Locator.

If you disable this policy setting, DC Locator APIs will ONLY return IPv4 DC address if any. So if the domain controller supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, DC Locator APIs will return IPv4 address. But if the domain controller supports only IPv6 address, then DC Locator APIs will fail.

If you do not configure this policy setting, DC Locator APIs can return IPv4/IPv6 DC address. This is the default behavior of the DC Locator.</string>

      <string id="Netlogon_AllowNT4Crypto_Help">This setting controls whether the Net Logon service will allow the use of older cryptography algorithms that are used in Windows NT 4.0. The cryptography algorithms used in Windows NT 4.0 and earlier are not as secure as newer algorithms used in Windows 2000,  Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and this version of Windows.

By default, Net Logon will not allow the older cryptography algorithms to be used and will not include them in the negotiation of cryptography algorithms. Therefore, computers running Windows NT 4.0 will not be able to establish a connection to this domain controller.
 
If this setting is enabled, Net Logon will allow the negotiation and use of older cryptography algorithms compatible with Windows NT 4.0. However, using the older algorithms represents a potential security risk.</string>
      <string id="Netlogon_IgnoreIncomingMailslotMessages">Do not process incoming mailslot messages used for domain controller location based on NetBIOS domain names</string>
      <string id="Netlogon_IgnoreIncomingMailslotMessages_Help">This policy setting allows you to control the processing of incoming mailslot messages by a local domain controller (DC).

Note: To locate a remote DC based on its NetBIOS (single-label) domain name, DC Locator first gets the list of DCs from a WINS server that is configured in its local client settings. DC Locator then sends a mailslot message to each remote DC to get more information. DC location succeeds only if a remote DC responds to the mailslot message.

This policy setting is recommended to reduce the attack surface on a DC, and can be used in an environment without WINS, in an IPv6-only environment, and whenever DC location based on a NetBIOS domain name is not required. This policy setting does not affect DC location based on DNS names.

If you enable this policy setting, this DC does not process incoming mailslot messages that are used for NetBIOS domain name based DC location.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, this DC processes incoming mailslot messages. This is the default behavior of DC Locator.</string>
