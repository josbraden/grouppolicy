      <string id="CustomLocalesNoSelect">Disallow selection of Custom Locales</string>
      <string id="CustomLocalesNoSelect_Help">This policy prevents a user from selecting a supplemental custom locale as their user locale. The user is restricted to the set of locales that shipped with the operating system.

Note that this does not affect the selection of replacement locales. To prevent the selection of replacement locales, adjust the permissions of the %windir%\Globalization directory to prevent the installation of locales by unauthorized users.

Note that "Restrict user locales" can also be enabled to disallow selection of a custom locale, even if this policy is not configured.

If this policy is Enabled, then the user cannot select a custom locale as their user locale, but they may still select a replacement locale if one is installed.

If the policy is Disabled or Not Configured, then the user may select a custom locale as their user locale.

If this policy is Enabled at the Machine level, it cannot be disabled by a per-User policy. If this policy is Disabled at the Machine level, then the per-User policy will be ignored. If this policy is Not Configured at the machine level, then restrictions will be based on per-User policies.

To set this policy on a per-user basis, make sure that the per-machine policy is set to Not Configured.

This policy does not, however, prevent an administrator or another application from changing these values programmatically.

The policy is used only to simplify the Regional Options control panel.

If the policy is Enabled, then the user will not be able to see the Administrative options.

If the policy is Disabled or Not Configured, then the user will see the Administrative options.

Note that even if a user can see the Administrative options, other policies may prevent them from modifying the values.</string>
      <string id="HideCurrentLocation">Hide the geographic location option</string>
      <string id="HideCurrentLocation_Help">This policy removes the option to change the user's geographical location (GeoID) from the Language and Regional Options control panel. This does not, however, prevent the user or an application from changing the GeoID programmatically.

The policy is used only to simplify the Regional Options control panel.

If the policy is Enabled, then the user will not see the option to change the user geographical location (GeoID).

The policy is only used to simplify the Regional Options control panel.

      <string id="LocaleSystemRestrict">Restrict system locales</string>
      <string id="LocaleSystemRestrict_Help">This policy restricts the permitted system locales to the specified list. If the list is empty, it locks the system locale to its current value. This policy does not change the existing system locale; however, the next time that an admin attempts to change the machine's system locale they will be restricted to the specified list.

The locale list is specified using language names, separated by a semi-colon (;). For example, en-US is English (United States).  Specifying "en-US;en-CA" would restrict the system locale to English (United States) and English (Canada).

If this policy is Enabled, then administrators may select a system locale only from the specified system locale list.

If this policy is Disabled or Not Configured, then administrators may select any system locale shipped with the operating system.</string>

To set this policy on a per-user basis, make sure that the per-machine policy is set to not configured.

The locale list is specified using language tags, separated by a semicolon (;). For example, en-US is English (United States).  Specifying "en-CA;fr-CA" would restrict the user locale to English (Canada) and French (Canada).

If this policy is Enabled, then only locales in the specified locale list may be selected by users.

If this policy is Disabled or Not Configured, then users may select any locale installed on the machine, unless restricted by the "Disallow selection of Custom Locales" policy.

If this policy is Enabled at the machine level, it cannot be disabled by a per-user policy. If this policy is disabled at the machine level, then the per-user policy will be ignored. If this policy is not configured at the machine level, then restrictions will be based on per-user policies.

Note that if an administrator has enabled the "Disallow selection of Custom Locales" policy, then users will be prevented from selecting supplemental custom locales, even if they are in the specified locale list for this policy.

      <string id="Y2K_Help">Determines how programs interpret two-digit years.

This setting specifies the largest two-digit year interpreted as being preceded by 20. All numbers less than or equal to the specified value are interpreted as being preceded by 20. All numbers greater than the specified value are interpreted as being preceded by 19.

For example, the default value, 2029, specifies that all two-digit years less than or equal to 29 (00 to 29) are interpreted as being preceded by 20, that is 2000 to 2029. Conversely, all two-digit years greater than 29 (30 to 99) are interpreted as being preceded by 19, that is, 1930 to 1999.

This setting only affects the programs that use this Windows feature to interpret two-digit years. If a program does not interpret two-digit years correctly, consult the documentation or manufacturer of the program.</string>
