      <string id="DiskQuota">Disk Quotas</string>
      <string id="DQ_Enable">Enable disk quotas</string>
      <string id="DQ_Enable_Help">Enables and disables disk quota management on all NTFS volumes of the computer, and prevents users from changing the setting.

If you enable this setting, disk quota management is enabled, and users cannot disable it.

If you disable the setting, disk quota management is disabled, and users cannot enable it.

If this setting is not configured, disk quota management is disabled by default, but administrators can enable it.

To prevent users from changing the setting while a setting is in effect, the system disables the "Enable quota management" option on the Quota tab of NTFS volumes.

Note: This setting enables disk quota management but does not establish or enforce a particular disk quota limit. To specify a disk quota limit, use the "Default quota limit and warning level" setting. Otherwise, the system uses the physical space on the volume as the quota limit.

Note: To enable or disable disk quota management without specifying a setting, in My Computer, right-click the name of an NTFS volume, click Properties, click the Quota tab, and then click the "Enable quota management" option.</string>
      <string id="DQ_Enforce">Enforce disk quota limit</string>
      <string id="DQ_Enforce_Help">Determines whether disk quota limits are enforced and prevents users from changing the setting.

If you enable this setting, disk quota limits are enforced. If you disable this setting, disk quota limits are not enforced. When you enable or disable the setting, the system disables the "Deny disk space to users exceeding quota limit" option on the Quota tab so administrators cannot make changes while the setting is in effect.

If the setting is not configured, the disk quota limit is not enforced by default, but administrators change the setting.

Enforcement is optional. When users reach an enforced disk quota limit, the system responds as though the physical space on the volume were exhausted. When users reach an unenforced limit, their status in the Quota Entries window changes, but they can continue to write to the volume as long as physical space is available.

Note: This setting overrides user settings that enable or disable quota enforcement on their volumes.

Note: To specify a disk quota limit, use the "Default quota limit and warning level" setting. Otherwise, the system uses the physical space on the volume as the quota limit.</string>
      <string id="DQ_Limit">Default quota limit and warning level</string>
      <string id="DQ_Limit_Help">Specifies the default disk quota limit and warning level for new users of the volume.

This setting determines how much disk space can be used by each user on each of the NTFS file system volumes on a computer. It also specifies the warning level, the point at which the user's status in the Quota Entries window changes to indicate that the user is approaching the disk quota limit.

This setting overrides new usersâ€™ settings for the disk quota limit and warning level on their volumes, and it disables the corresponding options in the "Select the default quota limit for new users of this volume" section on the Quota tab.

This setting applies to all new users as soon as they write to the volume. It does not affect disk quota limits for current users or affect customized limits and warning levels set for particular users (on the Quota tab in Volume Properties).

If you disable this setting or do not configure it, the disk space available to users is not limited. The disk quota management feature uses the physical space on each volume as its quota limit and warning level.

When you select a limit, remember that the same limit applies to all users on all volumes, regardless of actual volume size. Be sure to set the limit and warning level so that it is reasonable for the range of volumes in the group.

This setting is effective only when disk quota management is enabled on the volume. Also, if disk quotas are not enforced, users can exceed the quota limit you set. When users reach the quota limit, their status in the Quota Entries window changes, but users can continue to write to the volume.</string>
      <string id="DQ_LogEventOverLimit">Log event when quota limit exceeded</string>
      <string id="DQ_LogEventOverLimit_Help">Determines whether the system records an event in the local Application log when users reach their disk quota limit on a volume, and prevents users from changing the logging setting.

If you enable this setting, the system records an event when the user reaches their limit. If you disable this setting, no event is recorded. Also, when you enable or disable this setting, the system disables the "Log event when a user exceeds their quota limit" option on the Quota tab, so administrators cannot change the setting while a setting is in effect.

If the setting is not configured, no events are recorded, but administrators can use the Quota tab option to change the setting.

This setting is independent of the enforcement settings for disk quotas. As a result, you can direct the system to log an event, regardless of whether or not you choose to enforce the disk quota limit.

Also, this setting does not affect the Quota Entries window on the Quota tab. Even without the logged event, users can detect that they have reached their limit, because their status in the Quota Entries window changes.

Note: To find the logging option, in My Computer, right-click the name of an NTFS file system volume, click Properties, and then click the Quota tab.</string>
      <string id="DQ_LogEventOverThreshold">Log event when quota warning level exceeded</string>
      <string id="DQ_LogEventOverThreshold_Help">Determines whether the system records an event in the Application log when users reach their disk quota warning level on a volume.

If you enable this setting, the system records an event. If you disable this setting, no event is recorded. When you enable or disable the setting, the system disables the corresponding "Log event when a user exceeds their warning level" option on the Quota tab, so that administrators cannot change logging while a setting is in effect.

If the setting is not configured, no event is recorded, but administrators can use the Quota tab option to change the logging setting.

This setting does not affect the Quota Entries window on the Quota tab. Even without the logged event, users can detect that they have reached their warning level because their status in the Quota Entries window changes.

Note: To find the logging option, in My Computer, right-click the name of an NTFS file system volume, click Properties, and then click the Quota tab.</string>
      <string id="DQ_RemovableMedia">Apply policy to removable media</string>
      <string id="DQ_RemovableMedia_Help">Extends the disk quota policies in this folder to NTFS file system volumes on removable media.

If you disable this setting or do not configure it, the disk quota policies established in this folder apply to fixed-media NTFS volumes only. Note: When this setting is applied, the computer will apply the disk quota to both fixed and removable media.</string>
