      <string id="EE_EnablePersistentTimeStamp_Help">The Persistent System Timestamp allows the system to detect the time of unexpected shutdowns by writing the current time to disk on a schedule controlled by the Timestamp Interval.

If you enable this setting, the Persistent System Timestamp will be refreshed according to the Timestamp Interval.

If you disable this setting, the Persistent System Timestamp will be turned off and the timing of unexpected shutdowns will not be detected.

If you do not configure this setting, the default behavior will occur.

Note: By default, the Persistent System Timestamp is refreshed every 60 seconds beginning with Windows Server 2003.  This feature may interfere with power configuration settings that turn off hard disks after a period of inactivity.  These power settings may be accessed in the Power Options Control Panel.</string>
