      <string id="AllowDefaultCredentials">Allow Delegating Default Credentials</string>
      <string id="AllowDefaultCredentials_Explain">This policy setting applies to applications using the Cred SSP component (for example: Terminal Server).

This policy applies when server authentication was achieved via a trusted X509 certificate or Kerberos.

If you enable this policy setting you can specify the servers to which the user's default credentials can be delegated (default credentials are those that you use when first logging on to Windows).

If you disable or do not configure (by default) this policy setting, delegation of default credentials is not permitted to any machine.

Note: The "Allow Delegating Default Credentials" can be set to one or more Service Principal Names (SPNs).  The SPN represents the target server to which the user credentials can be delegated.  The use of a single wildcard is permitted when specifying the SPN.

For Example:
TERMSRV/host.humanresources.fabrikam.com Terminal server running on host.humanresources.fabrikam.com machine
TERMSRV/* Terminal server running on all machines.
TERMSRV/*.humanresources.fabrikam.com Terminal server running on all machines in .humanresources.fabrikam.com</string>
      <string id="AllowDefCredentialsWhenNTLMOnly">Allow Delegating Default Credentials with NTLM-only Server Authentication</string>
      <string id="AllowDefCredentialsWhenNTLMOnly_Explain">This policy setting applies to applications using the Cred SSP component (for example: Terminal Server).

This policy applies when server authentication was achieved via NTLM.

If you enable this policy setting you can specify the servers to which the user's default credentials can be delegated (default credentials are those that you use when first logging on to Windows).

      <string id="AllowFreshCredentials">Allow Delegating Fresh Credentials</string>
      <string id="AllowFreshCredentials_Explain">This policy setting applies to applications using the Cred SSP component (for example: Terminal Server).

This policy applies when server authentication was achieved via a trusted X509 certificate or Kerberos.

If you enable this policy setting you can specify the servers to which the user's fresh credentials can be delegated (fresh credentials are those that you are prompted for when executing the application).

If you do not configure (by default) this policy setting, after proper mutual authentication, delegation of fresh credentials is permitted to Terminal Server running on any machine (TERMSRV/*).

If you disable this policy setting delegation of fresh credentials is not permitted to any machine.

Note: The "Allow Delegating Fresh Credentials" can be set to one or more Service Principal Names (SPNs).  The SPN represents the target server to which the user credentials can be delegated.  The use of a single wildcard is permitted when specifying the SPN.

For Example:
TERMSRV/host.humanresources.fabrikam.com

      <string id="AllowSavedCredentials">Allow Delegating Saved Credentials</string>
      <string id="AllowSavedCredentials_Explain">This policy setting applies to applications using the Cred SSP component (for example: Terminal Server).

This policy applies when server authentication was achieved via a trusted X509 certificate or Kerberos.

If you enable this policy setting you can specify the servers to which the user's saved credentials can be delegated (saved credentials are those that you elect to save/remember using the Windows credentials manager).

If you do not configure (by default) this policy setting, after proper mutual authentication, delegation of saved credentials is permitted to Terminal Server running on any machine (TERMSRV/*).

If you disable this policy setting delegation of saved credentials is not permitted to any machine.

If you do not configure (by default) this policy setting, after proper mutual authentication, delegation of saved credentials is permitted to Terminal Server running on any machine (TERMSRV/*) if the client machine is not a member of any domain. If the client is domain-joined, then by default the delegation of saved credentials is not permitted to any machine.

If you disable this policy setting delegation of saved credentials is not permitted to any machine.
