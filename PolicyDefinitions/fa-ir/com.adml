      <string id="AppMgmt_COM_SearchForCLSID_Help">Directs the system to search Active Directory for missing Component Object Model (COM) components that a program requires.

Many Windows programs, such as the MMC snap-ins, use the interfaces provided by the COM components. These programs cannot perform all of their functions unless Windows has internally registered the required components.

If you enable this setting and a component registration is missing, the system searches for it in Active Directory and if it is found, downloads it. The resulting searches might make some programs start or run slowly.

If you disable this setting or do not configure it, the program continues without the registration. As a result, the program might not perform all of its functions, or it might stop.

This setting appears in the Computer Configuration and User Configuration folders. If both settings are configured, the setting in Computer Configuration takes precedence over the setting in  User Configuration.</string>
